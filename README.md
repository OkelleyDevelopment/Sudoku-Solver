# Sudoku Solver

## Motivation

To build a program that can attempt to solve any sudoku board specified by the
user using a backtracking algorithm and then write the output to a specified
file.

This is an implementation of my original python project and has helped 
strengthen my C programming skills as well as further reinforcing the process 
of setting up a backtracking algorithm.

##Program Execution

1. Clone this repo by running this command in the terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/OkelleyDevelopment/SudokuSolver.git
    ```
2. Run the program using this command

    ```
    python3 sudoku.py
    ```
3. The program will then prompt the user for an input board.


## Known errors
